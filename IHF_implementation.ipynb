    "In classical general relativity, the definitions of conserved quantities like mass and angular momentum are intrinsically linked to spacetime symmetries. The mathematical object that describes such a symmetry is a Killing vector field. A vector field, denoted $\\xi^a$, is a Killing vector if it generates a continuous isometry, meaning that the metric tensor $g_{ab}$ is unchanged by a flow along $\\xi^a$. This condition is expressed by the vanishing of the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to $\\xi^\\mu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\xi} g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\nabla_\\mu \\xi_\\nu + \\nabla_\\nu \\xi_\\mu = 0$$\n",
    "where $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the covariant derivative compatible with $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of such a vector field implies a conserved quantity along geodesics, providing a rigorous basis for defining the total mass and angular momentum of a system. For stationary, isolated black holes, this approach is perfectly sufficient. The Schwarzschild spacetime, describing a non-rotating black hole, possesses a timelike Killing vector that leads to a conserved energy (mass). The Kerr spacetime, describing a rotating black hole, possesses both a timelike and an axial Killing vector, which allow for the unambiguous definition of both mass and spin angular momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this nice formalism breaks down in the context of a binary black hole merger. Such a system is fundamentally dynamic: the black holes inspiral, the spacetime geometry ripples and distorts, and mass-energy is radiated away in the form of gravitational waves. A spacetime that is evolving and radiating is neither stationary nor axisymmetric. Consequently, it does not possess the global symmetries required for the existence of exact Killing vector fields. Any definition of spin that relies on their existence is therefore inapplicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge motivates a search for an alternative definition. A natural candidate for the boundary of a black hole is its event horizonâ€”the global, teleological boundary in spacetime separating events that can send signals to a distant observer from those that cannot. However, the event horizon suffers from a critical flaw for practical computation: its location at any given time depends on the *entire future evolution* of the spacetime. It is impossible for a local observer to locate, and it is computationally impossible to determine during a step-by-step numerical simulation that evolves forward in time. This computational impasse was a primary driver for the development of a new, computable, and physically meaningful framework."

    "The solution to the breakdown of global definitions is to adopt a quasi-local approach, which defines physical quantities using only information contained within a finite region of spacetime. This method is centered on the concept of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), which are closed, spacelike 2-surfaces that can be located on a single 3D slice of a numerical simulation. An apparent horizon is typically defined as an outermost MOTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Isolated Horizons (IH): A State of Equilibrium**\n",
    "An Isolated Horizon provides a quasi-local description of a black hole in equilibrium with its surroundings. It is formally defined as a null 3-hypersurface $H$ on which the expansion of outgoing null rays is zero ($\\Theta=0$), and where the gravitational field is stationary *on* the horizon, even if the spacetime far away is dynamic. This idealization allows for the formulation of black hole mechanics without requiring global stationarity. A key condition on the preferred null normal vector $\\ell^a$ to the horizon is that the intrinsic geometry of the horizon cross-sections is constant along the flow of $\\ell^a$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_\\ell q_{AB} = 0$. This condition ensures that the surface gravity is constant across the horizon, leading to a quasi-local zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamical Horizons (DH): The Fully General Case**\n",
    "For a truly evolving black hole, such as during a merger, the Isolated Horizon framework is extended to that of a Dynamical Horizon. A DH is a *spacelike* 3-dimensional manifold that is foliated by MOTS. Unlike an IH, a DH has a net influx of energy and angular momentum, causing its area to increase over time. This framework is powerful because it allows for the derivation of local flux laws that generalize the first and second laws of black hole mechanics. These laws relate the change in the horizon's area, mass, and spin directly to the flux of matter and gravitational radiation crossing the horizon boundary. This provides a direct, computable link between the dynamics of the merger and the properties of the resulting black hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of this quasi-local formalism was not merely an academic exercise to find an alternative to global definitions. It was a fundamental and necessary evolution of the theory, driven directly by the practical challenges and capabilities of numerical relativity. The inability to compute event horizons in real-time forced a re-evaluation of what defines a black hole from an operational standpoint, leading to a new theoretical structure built around the computable concept of apparent horizons."
